Chef likes strings a lot but he likes palindromic strings more. Today, Chef has two strings A and B, each consisting of lower case alphabets.Chef is eager to know whether it is possible to choose some non empty strings s1 and s2 where s1 is a substring of A, s2 is a substring of B such that s1 + s2 is a palindromic string. Here '+' denotes the concatenation between the strings.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
   char a[1001],b[1001];
   int i,j,flag,t;
   scanf("%d",&t);
  while(t--)
     {
     	scanf("%s%s",a,b);
     	i=0;
     	flag=0;
     	
     	  while(a[i]!='\0')
     		{
 			j=0;
 			while(b[j]!='\0')
 			 {
 			   if(a[i]==b[j])
 			     {
                                flag=1;
                                break;    		
                             }
                            j++;
                          }
                         if(flag==1)
                           break;
                           i++;
               }
            if(flag==1)
             printf("Yes\n");
            else
             printf("No\n");
     }
